    We are hard at work on the development of a new food centre facility for
    Inukjuammiut. The proposed new facility will have an open concept kitchen
    and dining room that will dramatically increase our building capacity,
    allowing more Inukjuammiut to participate in all that Sirivik does. 

    The centre will be linked to the current hydroponic greenhouse, while also establishing a new year round soil based greenhouse for community members to grow their own food. From seed to plate all under one roof!

  - title: Sirivik’s current facility limits our program capacity
    description: "At current, our space is too limited to host all the individuals
      that access our program. As a result our meal services are predominately
      take out and our kitchen cooking activities are limited in numbers and are
      always a squeeze. "

    The Pirursiivik greenhouse and social arts project was created to improve
    the community’s health and wellness. From 2017 to 2022 the project worked on
    an array of programs strengthening food security in Inukjuak and local food
    production across Nunavik. 


    The project was a collaboration of the One Drop Foundation and Makivik Corporation. 


    The development of this facility is the continuation of the hard work done by the Pirursiivik project team to establish a local growing facility in Inukjuak.

  description: >-
    The current estimate for the building is $7 million. 


    Our goal is to break ground in the summer of 2023, opening the doors to the new facility in the spring of 2024. 


    We are well on our way to acquiring the funds, however, we are not there just yet. If you are interested in supporting the project, you have questions, comments or concerns do not hesitate to reach out to our team.
