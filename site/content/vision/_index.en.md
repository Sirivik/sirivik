    We are hard at work on the development of a new food centre facility for
    Inukjuammiut. The proposed new facility will have an open concept kitchen
    and dining room that will dramatically increase our building capacity,
    allowing more Inukjuammiut to participate in all that Sirivik does. 

    The centre will be linked to the current hydroponic greenhouse, while also establishing a new year round soil based greenhouse for community members to grow their own food. From seed to plate all under one roof!

    The Pirursiivik greenhouse and social arts project was created to improve
    the community’s health and wellness. From 2017 to 2022 the project worked on
    an array of programs strengthening food security in Inukjuak and local food
    production across Nunavik. 


    The project was a collaboration of the One Drop Foundation and Makivik Corporation. 


    The development of this facility is the continuation of the hard work done by the Pirursiivik project team to establish a local growing facility in Inukjuak.

    The long winters and lack of road infrastructure make for a short and
    expensive construction timeline across Nunavik. The current estimate for the
    building is $7 million. 


    We are well on our way to acquiring the funds, however, we are not there just yet.
