  subtitle: >-
    We are hard at work on the development of a new food centre facility for
    Inukjuammiut. The proposed new facility will dramatically increase our
    building capacity, allowing more Inukjuammiut to participate in all that
    Sirivik does. 

    The centre will have ample space for cooking and country food preparation. It will be linked to the current hydroponic greenhouse, and will also include a new year round soil based greenhouse for community members to grow their own food.

  - title: Sirivik’s current facility limits our program capacity
    description: "At current, our space is too limited to host all the individuals
      that access our program. As a result our meal services are predominately
      take out and our kitchen cooking activities are limited in numbers and are
      always a squeeze. "

    description: In a region already plagued with high rates of food insecurity,
      Hudson Bay residents feel this pressure most severely. Continued action to
      address this critical issue is essential.

    The Pirursiivik greenhouse and social arts project was created to improve
    the community’s health and wellness. From 2017 to 2022 the project worked on
    an array of programs strengthening food security in Inukjuak and local food
    production across Nunavik. 


    The project was a collaboration of the One Drop Foundation and Makivik Corporation. 


    The development of this facility is the continuation of the hard work done by the Pirursiivik project team to establish a local growing facility in Inukjuak.

  title: Funding Campaign & Project Timeline
  description: >-
    Sirivik has lead a successful capital campaign to secure the approximately
    $8 million needed for the new facility.


    The new facility construction began in earnest in July of 2024, and is now well under way, with the facility set to be completed in the spring of 2025.
