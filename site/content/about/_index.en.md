  heading: Our Story
  description: >-
    A dedicated group of volunteers and a whole lot of heart planted the seed of
    Sirivik in 2013. In it’s early days Sirivik was a community kitchen program
    at the local Family House; a group of compassionate individuals distributing
    meals on a monthly basis to Inukjuammiut. During that time the need to have
    more permanent and reliable food services in our community became apparent.
    As a result after 5 successful years of growth the ‘Sirivik Soup Kitchen’
    opened the doors of its very own facility and operational kitchen in April
    of 2018!


    In the time since Sirivik has continued to flourish. We became a registered non-profit organization in May of 2020. We dropped our ‘Soup Kitchen’ title to better encapsulate the scope of our work. Operating as a food centre we are able to provide a wider array of programs and initiatives, finding creative solutions to addressing food security in our community. 


    Our name Sirivik comes from the expression we use in Inuktitut to demonstrate our gratitude and excitement before sharing a meal.


    We continue to evolve our program to better meet the needs of our community, as Inukjuak continues to grow and change so will we. Contributing to an Inuit led food system that prioritizes our needs and celebrates our culture and community.
