  Our Drop In hours run weekdays from 9-4pm. All community members are welcome
  and invited to stop by for a visit, a hot cup of coffee and a healthy snack.


  Our pantry table is prepped with an assortment of non-perishable goods available to all community members. We keep home cooked frozen meals, ingredients and country food on hand to share with community members who drop in hungry or in need of food support.
