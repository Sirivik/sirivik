  Our Food box program offers food support to 50 households on a weekly basis in
  Inukjuak. The scope of the program is limited to households in urgent and
  immediate need of food support and focuses on our most vulnerable within the
  community. 


  Each box aims to contain food staples as well as complimentary basic recipes related to box contents in an effort to increase healthy eating and food preparation skills among participants  



  The food box program was created during the spring covid lockdown of 2020, and has continued due to the generous support of local organizations and volunteers.
