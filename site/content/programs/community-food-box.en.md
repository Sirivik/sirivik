  Our Food box program offers food box delivery on a needs basis to
  Inukjuammiut. Households in immediate need of food support can contact Sirivik
  for assistance. This initiative focuses on our most vulnerable within the
  community. 


  Each box is unique and aims to contain food staples, as well as basic recipes related to box contents in an effort to increase healthy eating and food preparation skills among participants. 


  The food box program was created during the spring covid lockdown of 2020, and has evolved in the time since, taking on many forms while ensuring food support for Inukjuammiut persists.
