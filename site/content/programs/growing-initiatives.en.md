blurb: Growing fresh food locally in the Arctic!
description: >-
  As a fly-in arctic community accessing fresh herbs and vegetables can be
  difficult due toÂ  harsh weather conditions and limited infrastructure. To help
  increase access to fresh healthy food we own and operate a 40 foot hydroponic
  greenhouse container; growing ample greens without soil in subzero
  temperatures. The greenhouse produces leafy greens including quingilliit a
  local favourite, native to the Inukjuak tundra. 


  In our main facility we also host a small hydroponic growing tower system which is used as an educational tool for our programs. While, our window garden and outdoor cold frame provide us the space to experiment with soil growing; we've planted everything from tomatoes and garlic, to broccoli and berries. 


  We use our locally grown fresh herbs and vegetables in recipes, programming, and they are regularly shared free of charge with community members.


  Close collaboration with the Pirursiivik Greenhouse and Social Arts Project helped us expand and develop our growing related initiatives from sprouting to composting.
