title: Growing Initiatives
blurb: Growing fresh food locally in the Arctic!
description: >-
  As a fly-in arctic community accessing fresh herbs and vegetables can be
  difficult due toÂ  harsh weather conditions and limited infrastructure. To help
  mitigate these challenges we own and operate a 40 foot hydroponic greenhouse
  container; growing ample greens without soil in subzero temperatures! 


  In our main facility we also host a small hydroponic growing tower system which is used as an educational tool for our programs. Our window garden and outdoor cold frame provide us the space to experiment with soil growing; we've planted everything from tomatoes and garlic, to broccoli and berries. 


  We use our locally grown fresh herbs and vegetables in recipes, programming and they are regularly shared free of charge with community members.


  Close collaboration with the Pirursiivik Greenhouse and Social Arts Project helped us expand and develop our growing related initiatives from sprouting to composting.
